This repo is my version of an [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-react-native/) course

## üöÄ Setup

To run this calculator you'll need Node 12 LTS or greater installed.

This setup will show how to run it in web browser or from Android(windows/linux)/IOS(macOs) using a real device.

For running in a virtual device, consider visiting [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) website .

### Expo CLI Quickstart
You can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## ‚≠ê Run
In the calculator directory
```bash
npm start
```
### Running your React Native application
Install the [Expo](https://expo.io/) client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. 

On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. 

On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the Camera app. 

In order to run the calculator in üíª web browser, in the Metro Bundler, click 'Run in web browser' option press F12 and play with the responsiveness.
